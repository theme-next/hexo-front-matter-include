== Use

You defined one or more keys that you want to include from `config` or `data` file.

In hexo or theme:

[source,yaml]
----
---
title: Some Word...
include: post_overview
# include: [post_overview, post_webfront, ....]
---
----

And you should config your keys in `config` file. Like:

[source,yaml]
----
post_overview:
  categories: [overview]
  tags: [overview]
  comments: false
  toc_number: false
  ...
----

Or write in `post_overview` data file (`source/_data/post_overview.yml`).

[source,yaml]
----
categories: [overview]
tags: [overview]
comments: false
toc_number: false
...
----
